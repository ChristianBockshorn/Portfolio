            <p id="aboutMeText">
                I am a Frontend developer based in Kaiserslautern, Germany. I help designers and companies to bring their
                ideas to real life. Creativity and logical thinking are skills that I have developed to connect
                ideas
                into quality products. If you think Iâ€™d be a good match for your projects, contact me!
